# Presidents and assholes

In a new directory, create a brand new frontend for this project using `create-react-app` and clone down (and use) this api to build the following:

##### Iteration 0:  

First thing we want to do is fetch some info for us to display. **Thunks are not required**
You are going to want to grab all the president data and populate a redux store. You should also have `isLoading` and `hasErrored` properties in your store. The data can be found at this API endpoint: `get http://localhost:3001/api/v1/presidents`.

##### Iteration 1:

Once you've populated your redux store with your data you are going to want to display the data as a card. While we wait for our data to arrive please provide a loading message for the front-end.

Things to display:
`number, president, birth_year, death_year, took_office, left_office, party`

##### Iteration 2: 

You basically have a full website now. The only thing left to do is test your actions, reducers, mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps. You may reference the docs and the `Testing Redux` lesson, but may not look at past projects. 

**You are not required to test your async code (including thunks)**

##### Iteration 3:

Add a party filter dropdown that determines which presidents to display based on political party. The current party should be stored in the redux store.

Test that filter functionality.
